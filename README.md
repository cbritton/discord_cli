## Building

This application takes advantage of the trimmed and self-contained single executable features in .NET Core 3.0 so there will be no support dll libraries with the executable.

A cake (v 0.34.1) build file is provided but is not necessary.  To build the application with cake, just run the supplied build script.
```
.\build.ps1 -Target Release
```

If you prefer to build with dotnet, this should do what you need:

```
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release 
```

This is tested on Windows 10.
